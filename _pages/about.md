<!-- ## About -->

Hi! This is Sunny, I am a graduate student at MIT advised by Professor [Peter Shor](https://math.mit.edu/~shor/) and [Anand Natarajan](https://www.mit.edu/~anandn/). My research is in quantum computation, with a focus in quantum error correction. I believe quantum computational power is a fundamental new resource bestowed to us by nature, and quantum error correction is the procedure that refines this raw resource for use in applications. I hope my work contributes to the constructions and later improvements of truly fault-tolerant, large-scale quantum computers in not-too-many decades.

Prior to grad school I was an undergrad at CMU. I worked in graph algorithms with Professor [Anupam Gupta](https://cs.nyu.edu/~anupamg/) and [Jason Li](https://q3r.github.io/), and combinatorics with Professor [Boris Bukh](https://www.borisbukh.org/) and [Michael Tait](https://sites.google.com/view/michaeltait).

## New preprints
- A highly flexible, optimizable and scalable architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computers based on QLDPC codes, powered by a new primitive called __extractor__ which can augment any QLDPC memory into a computational block.  
[Extractors: QLDPC Architecture for Efficient Pauli-Based Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10390)

- Quantum LDPC code surgery can perform parallel measurements.  
[Parallel Logical Measurements via Quantum Code Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05003)
- Punctured quantum Reed-Solomon Codes have transversal and addressable CCZ gates. [Quantum Codes with Addressable and Transversal Non-Clifford Gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01864)
- Magic state distillation works!

## Talks and Travel {#talks}

- In Fall 2024, I helped organize a reading group on Quantum Fault-Tolerance with Rachel Zhang, Adam Wills and Vinod Vaikuntanathan. 
- I presented a recent work with IBM on [Improved QLDPC Surgery: Logical Measurements and Bridging Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18393) at the [Fault-Tolerant Quantum Technologies Workshop](https://www.benasque.org/2024ftqt/) at Benasque, Spain. Here are a few [photos](/travel#Benasque) of the mountain town of Benasque. I also presented this work at QIP 2025.
- I presented our work on [Single-shot decoding of good quantum LDPC codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12470) at TQC 2024 hosted in Okinawa, Japan. Here are some [photos](/travel#Japan) of Japan.
- I gave a guest lecture at UCLA on [An Introduction to Quantum LDPC Codes](files/QLDPC_UCLA.pdf) in March 2024, hosted by Professor [Jens Palsberg](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/). 
- I attended QEC 2023 at Sydney, Australia. Did you know that visitors can pet [koalas and (small) kangaroos](/travel#Sydney) at the [Featherdale Wildlife Park](https://www.featherdale.com.au/)?
- I presented our work with IBM on [Quantum Locally Testable Code with Constant Soundness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11405) at QIP 2023 in Gent, Belgium. Here are some [photos](/travel#Gent) of the beautiful city of Gent. I also presented this work at IBM Yorktown.
- In Summer 2023, I attended the [Quantum Summer Cluster Workshop](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/quantum-summer-cluster-workshop) at Simons Institute.
- In Spring 2022, I helped organize a reading group on Asymptotically Good QLDPC Codes with Eugene Tang and Anand Natarajan.

## Experiences {#exp}
- I was a summer intern at [QuEra](https://www.quera.com/) in 2024. 
- In Spring 2024, I attended the [Quantum Algorithms, Complexity, and Fault Tolerance Workshop](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/quantum-algorithms-complexity-fault-tolerance), hosted by [Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage) at UC Berkeley.
- I was a summer intern at [IBM Quantum](https://www.ibm.com/quantum) in 2022 and 2023. 
- In Fall 2022, I was a TA for [Peter Shor's course on Quantum Computation](https://math.mit.edu/~shor/435-LN/).
