<!-- ## About -->

Hi! This is Sunny, I am a graduate student at MIT advised by Professor [Peter Shor](https://math.mit.edu/~shor/) and [Anand Natarajan](https://www.mit.edu/~anandn/). My research is in quantum computation, with a focus in quantum error correction. I believe quantum computational power is a fundamental new resource bestowed to us by nature, and quantum error correction is the procedure that refines this raw resource for use in applications. I hope my work contributes to the constructions and later improvements of truly fault-tolerant, large-scale quantum computers in not-too-many decades.

Prior to grad school I was an undergrad at CMU. I worked in graph algorithms with Professor [Anupam Gupta](https://cs.nyu.edu/~anupamg/) and [Jason Li](https://q3r.github.io/), and combinatorics with Professor [Boris Bukh](https://www.borisbukh.org/) and [Michael Tait](https://sites.google.com/view/michaeltait).

## Recent Works
- Fault-tolerance is, at its core, a combinatorial study.

- **Extractor architectures**: A flexible architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computers based on QLDPC codes, powered by a new primitive called **extractor** which can augment any quantum code into a computational processor.
